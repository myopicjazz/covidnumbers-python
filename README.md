# covidnumbers-python
Requires python 3 and requests module.

Pulls covid numbers from NY Times github repos
to show top five states in US for infections, then deaths.
Also shows worst counties in selected states and numbers
for specific, pre-selected counties.

Runs correctly on Mac and Linux.
May need modification for Windows use.
